It's easy and free. There is no cost or obligation to attend if you apply. First, you'll meet with our admissions team where some of your questions or concerns will be answered. The next step of the interview process is to meet with the instructional staff.

We encourage you to bring anyone from your support group that you feel may want understand more about where you will be spending a large portion of your time for three months.

After that, we let you know if you are accepted and then you can start your prework and _welcome aboard!_
