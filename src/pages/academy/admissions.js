          <h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

          <p>
            The suggested computer for students is an Apple MacBook Pro laptop
            less than two years old. Minimum requirements:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>8GB of RAM</li>
            <li>500GB HDD</li>
            <li>
              macOS High Sierra (10.13) or Windows 10, subject to approval (see
              below)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Why a Mac? All of our students being on the same platform enables us
            to move at a much quicker pace. Processes like setting up new tools
            experience reduced friction because the same workflows apply to
            everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, The open source and web development communities are
            invested in tools and libraries that work best with POSIX based
            operating systems like UNIX, Linux, and Apple’s macOS (BSD Unix). In
            short, we believe using the macOS best prepares our students to work
            in the web development industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Students who choose to study .NET development with us may also find
            substantial benefit from using macOS. A PC laptops can be approved
            for class use on a case by case basis during the interview process.
          </p>
